For today, I decided to realx a bit. Learning Haskell again yesterday took up a lot of my time, so today, I decided to use Python.
I am quite familiar with Python, and everything is just easy(er) in this language.
Going through all lines in the input and checking the number of 1's was not hard, but after having done so by hand, I realized that
I probably should have used NumPy to sum the contents of each of the 12 collumns, then dividing by 2.

Python also has a method for convering binary to deciman, which I used for exercise 2.
